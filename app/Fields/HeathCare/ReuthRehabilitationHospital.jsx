      <Text>Reuth Rehabilitation Hospital in Tel Aviv offers an especially attractive workplace for women in healthcare, combining a mission-driven environment with strong professional support. As Israel’s largest rehabilitation center, Reuth is dedicated to helping patients regain independence and dignity—making it a deeply meaningful place to work. Many of the core roles at Reuth, including nursing, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy, are female-majority professions, and the hospital’s collaborative, interdisciplinary care model ensures that women’s voices are integral to patient outcomes. With a major new campus currently in development, there will be growing opportunities for advancement, leadership, and professional development. Reuth is known for its warm, inclusive culture, often described by staff as family-like, where cooperation and respect are highly valued. For women seeking work-life balance, many clinical roles offer part-time or flexible scheduling options. As a nonprofit institution, Reuth is also well-positioned to prioritize ethical practices and gender inclusivity more effectively than large bureaucratic systems. With its expanding vision, supportive environment, and commitment to human-centered care, Reuth presents a compelling opportunity for women looking to make a real difference in healthcare while growing their careers.</Text>
